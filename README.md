# IoT application in healthcare field
Industry 4.0 is characterized by the integration of digital technologies in industrial processes, creating a revolution in the way industrial sectors operate thanks to it. The hospital sector is a good example of this, the implementation of IoT devices that allow real-time monitoring of medical equipment is one of the many possible applications.
The present project is carried out at the request of a company in the pharmaceutical sector dedicated to the production and distribution of medical gasses that recently also provides several services based on an installation, in growth, of data collection by IoT in different hospitals in the Iberian Peninsula. The information is presented to customers through an application that integrates the dashboards of the contracted services. This work explores new ways of using this information for the development of functionalities that support the tasks of other departments. It will be structured according to a relational model to facilitate subsequent exploitation, analyzing the use that hospitals make of the gasses provided, the creation of an alarm system that provides robustness to the collection process and the sending of reports to other departments that allow them to know their operational efficiency. The results obtained make it clear that the benefit obtained both for the organization, and ultimately for the clients, from the collection and processing of data far exceeds the costs that these may entail.
